##This program is a data-based Aritificial Intelligence which looks at probablities of many combinations that the user utilizes and then predicts what the player will input next.
##The program has 2 different prediction logics. One is straighforward which just looks at what is the most appropriate prediction based on a single node probability. 
##One is notstraightforward which makes sure that if the user wants to juke the AI it can predict with what will the user juke the AI with. It also predicts when the User decides to do so
